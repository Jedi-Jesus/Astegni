---

### 2. ✅ **Rating System: 5-Factor → 4-Factor**

**Removed**: Retention (as requested)

**Before**:
- 5-Factor Rating System (Subject Matter, Communication, **Retention**, Discipline, Punctuality)

**After**:
- 4-Factor Rating System (Subject Matter Expertise, Communication Skills, Discipline, Punctuality)

**Updated Throughout Document**:
- ✅ Executive Summary
- ✅ Section 3.1 "The 4-Factor Tutor Rating System"
- ✅ Section 3.3 "How It Works" (student rating step)
- ✅ Section 7.1 "What Makes Astegni Unique" (comparison table)
- ✅ Conclusion

**Enhanced Descriptions**:
- Subject Matter Expertise: "Does the tutor/instructor truly know the subject or skill?" → Emphasizes both academic and non-academic
- Communication Skills: "Can the tutor explain concepts clearly in the appropriate language?" → Added language emphasis (addresses English speaking issue from user research)

---

### 3. ✅ **Non-Academic Programs Emphasis**

**Major Addition**: Astegni serves BOTH academic and non-academic skill training

**Academic Programs**:
- Math, Science, English, Social Studies, etc. (K-12 + University)

**Non-Academic Programs Added**:
- 🎵 **Music**: Piano, guitar, vocals, drums, traditional instruments
- 🍳 **Culinary Arts**: Cooking, baking, pastry, food presentation
- 💄 **Cosmetology**: Hair styling, makeup, beauty treatments, spa services
- 🌍 **Languages**: Foreign language learning (French, Spanish, Chinese, etc.)
- 🎨 **Arts**: Painting, drawing, sculpture, digital art, photography
- ⚽ **Sports**: Football, basketball, tennis, athletics, swimming
- 🔧 **Vocational Skills**: Tailoring, carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, mechanics
- ♿ **Programs for Differently-Abled Learners**: Sign language, braille, specialized education, adaptive learning

**Updated Sections**:
- ✅ Executive Summary: "25+ million students seeking both academic and non-academic skills"
- ✅ Section 1.1 "Problem Statement": "parents hire private tutors and instructors... for both academic subjects and non-academic skills"
- ✅ Section 2.1 "Ethiopian Market Size":
  - Split market into academic (500M ETB) + non-academic (200M ETB)
  - **Total addressable market: 700M+ ETB** (~$12.6M USD)
- ✅ Section 3.1 "Rating System": "Does the tutor/instructor truly know the subject or skill? Ensures qualified teaching across academic and non-academic domains (math, music, culinary arts, etc.)"
- ✅ Conclusion: "across both academic and non-academic domains"

---

### 4. ✅ **Updated Real User Research Quote**

**Before**:
> "I once wanted a tutor for my children, so I went to a university to ask for a teacher. They gave me someone. When the teacher came, my children told me that his communication skills were so low that the children knew more than him. We had to let him go and start searching all over again."

**After**:
> "I once wanted a tutor for my children, so I went to a university to ask for a teacher. They gave me someone. When the teacher came, my children told me that his communication skills in English were so low that the children knew more than him, **as most teachers at that time had English speaking problems**. We had to let him go and start searching all over again."

**Why This Matters**:
- Adds **specific context**: English language communication is a real problem in Ethiopia
- Validates the Communication Skills factor in our rating system
- Makes the pain point more concrete and relatable
- Shows this isn't an isolated incident (systemic issue: "most teachers at that time")

---

### 5. ✅ **Removed "Offline-Capable" Feature**

**Before**:
```
Key Features:
- No-build process (lightweight, fast deployment)
- Modular architecture (maintainable, scalable)
- Offline-capable (works without internet for core features)  ← REMOVED
- Mobile-first responsive design
```

**After**:
```
Key Features:
- No-build process (lightweight, fast deployment)
- Modular architecture (maintainable, scalable)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for app-like experience  ← ADDED
```

**Why Removed**:
- "Offline-capable" was unclear and potentially misleading
- Astegni is a **cloud-based platform** requiring internet for core features (tutoring marketplace, digital whiteboard, live sessions)
- Replaced with "PWA capabilities" which is more accurate (app-like experience, faster loading, but still requires internet)

---

### 6. ✅ **Localization Emphasis Updated (Current Phase)**

**Before**:
```
| Localization | ✅ Ethiopian curriculum, languages, pricing | ❌ Generic, Western-focused |
```

**After**:
```
| Localization | ✅ Phase 1: Ethiopian curriculum, languages, pricing; Phases 2-3: Adapts to each country's curriculum globally | ❌ Generic, Western-focused |
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Clarifies that Ethiopian localization is **Phase 1 only**
- Shows the global vision: In Phase 2 (Africa) and Phase 3 (Global), Astegni will adapt to **each country's curriculum**
- Examples:
  - Kenya: Kenyan 8-4-4 system, Swahili language, KES pricing
  - Nigeria: Nigerian 6-3-3-4 system, Yoruba/Hausa/Igbo languages, NGN pricing
  - USA: American curriculum, English, USD pricing
  - India: CBSE/ICSE curriculum, Hindi/regional languages, INR pricing

**No Longer Misleading**: The comparison table now accurately shows Astegni's **current** localization (Ethiopia) while indicating future global adaptation.
