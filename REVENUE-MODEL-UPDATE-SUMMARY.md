## Why This Model is Better

### 1. **Predictable Recurring Revenue**
- Subscription model = predictable MRR/ARR
- Commission model = unpredictable, tied to session volume

### 2. **Higher Margins**
- Subscription: 88% gross margin
- Commission: 72% gross margin

### 3. **Faster Payback**
- Subscription: 1.7 months payback
- Commission: Longer payback due to lower per-transaction revenue

### 4. **Viral Growth Engine**
- Affiliate program incentivizes user acquisition
- 20% direct + 10% indirect = 2-tier referral system
- Lower CAC over time as referrals increase

### 5. **Cleaner User Experience**
- No hidden fees or commissions per session
- Transparent pricing: 300 ETB/month, unlimited bookings
- Package-based booking (1/2/3 sessions or full week) → Easier to understand

### 6. **Better for Tutors**
- No commission taken per session (keep 100% of tutor fees)
- Only pay 300 ETB/month subscription
- More predictable income
