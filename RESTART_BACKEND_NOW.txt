RESTART BACKEND IMMEDIATELY

The Problem:
Backend code has been fixed, but the server is still running OLD CODE in memory.

Fixed Issues:
1. Changed messages -> chat_messages (all occurrences)
2. Changed INSERT INTO messages -> INSERT INTO chat_messages
3. Changed FROM messages -> FROM chat_messages

But the backend is still using old code because it hasn't been restarted!

How to Restart:

In your backend terminal window:
1. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
2. Wait for it to stop completely
3. Restart:
   cd astegni-backend
   python app.py

What Should Happen After Restart:
- No more "relation messages does not exist" errors
- Conversations loading successfully
- Chat modal working properly

Current Error (Before Restart):
relation "messages" does not exist
LINE 16: FROM messages m

After Restart:
Successfully loading conversations from chat_messages table

Next Steps After Restart:
1. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl + Shift + R
2. Click Message button
3. Check console - should see no 500 errors
